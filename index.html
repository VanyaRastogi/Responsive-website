                    application
                    in all techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in industrial production and scientific
                    research.
                    Technology is embedded in the operation of all machines, with or without detailed knowledge of their
                    function, for the intended purpose of an organization. The technologies of society consist of what
                    is
                    known as systems.</p>

                processes, and the theoretical foundations for supporting learning and teaching. Educational technology
                is not restricted to high technology but is anything that enhances classroom learning in the utilization
                of blended, face to face, or online learning.As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prominent in
                this age of big data, it has also been widely adopted in K-12 classrooms. One prominent class of
                AI-enhanced educational technology is intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), designed to provide immediate
                and personalized feedbacks to students. Since technology is not the end goal of education, but rather
                a means by which it can be accomplished, educators must have a good grasp of the technology and its

                professional development days are inadequate.</p>

            <p class="sectionbody textsmall">Learning can happen anywhere and at any time. In addition, and largely due
                to the learning curves introduced by technological advancements and industries including
                entrepreneurship, learning is not limited to educational settings . Within the educational realm,
                teachers
                are embracing new technological tools and using them within their teaching practice. These tools help
                contribute to new learning approaches and learning preferences.
                Instead of teaching mostly facts and using assessment-based learning, teaching practices have begun to
                move towards competency development.
                Many technology-based approaches increasingly offer opportunities for students to create content that
                may be shared within the classroom, throughout schools, and on online learning platforms and LMS
                (Learning Management Systems).Another way technology has impacted society is through communication, how
                we talk and communicate with one another worldwide.</p>
